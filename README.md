In this module, I hve created various utility functions for scopes of variables and functions

Various Methods are as below:

## check_func_doc_string
This method checks whether the passed function has docstring greater than 50 characters

## function_less_doc_comments
Funciton having less than 50 character doc comments

## function_more_doc_comments
Funciton having more than 50 character doc comments

## next_fibonacci_num
This method return the next fibonacci number
	
## func_calls_dict
Global dictionary which will keep track of how mnay times methods add, mul, div is called

## count_function_calls_global_dict
This method updates a global dictionary func_calls_dict, how many times methods add,mul, div is called
		
## add
This function returns summation of two parameters a and b 
	
## mul
This function returns result of multiplication of parameters a and b

## div
This function returns result of division of parameter a by b


## count_function_calls_local_dict 
This method updates a dictionary passed as parameter to teh fuction to keep track of how many times methods add,mul, div is called
